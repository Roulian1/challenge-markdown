## You can always count on me when :

There's something to translate from english (I'm feeling confident when I translate the sense but if there are some technical terms, I would probably have to search for the vocabulary)

## A funny story :

I don't have a funny story for the moment so I'll try to think of one before the end of the day and I'll try to complete the exercise during this time.

### Abstract funny story :

I don't have one.
